Simple CGI runner in Go.

Give it a directory full of CGIs and it will serve them from the given address.

EXAMPLE

  $ cgirunner -dir=/srv/cgi-bin -addr=localhost:8111 -root=/hello

If in /srv/cgi-bin there's an executable called "mama.cgi", it will be
available at http://localhost:8181/hello/mama.cgi.

NOTE

The program loads a list of CGIs during startup, so to serve new CGIs,
it must be restarted.

IMPORTANT

Doesn't clean environment variables. Depending on your CGI scripts,
this may be a security risk. Use https://github.com/gnosek/fcgiwrap.
